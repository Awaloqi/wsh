Some prefer to have their shirts Dry Cleaned to preserve the color and texture and overall design, look and feel of the garment. Laundry on the other hand is typically on button-down, 100% Cotton Shirts that are washed (water + detergent), and machine pressed. Wash & Fold is also in this category (Laundry), however without press as the items are folded - <b>not pressed</b>. Moreover,some shirts with detail,such as snap-on buttons, wooden buttons, silk overall or around collar and sleeves etc, will require hand-press and as a result will be in the dry clean category.
